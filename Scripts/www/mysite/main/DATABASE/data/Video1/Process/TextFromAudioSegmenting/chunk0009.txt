maybe I should we had before was it before class so if I could before class in here I know that this needs to be static if I run this notice will feel there's no reception run because this needs to be static and then we can see that this can't be referenced from a static context because this isn't static so I need to make this static then hopefully that's wrong again and the point here is this is what we wanted in the first place that because we quoted essentially in the wrong order because we started with the variable then we added the app before class
