and use it to get an integer but if there's no scanner in there at all and I try to do something with it I can't cuz nothing's there it's like saying I have a pen I take the cap off the pest if there's no pain here to begin with I can't I can't do anything I can't take a cap off it because it's not there to begin with I'm pointing to nothing and that makes it not work a null pointer exception so I really hope this was helpful for you
