so I'm going to hopefully try to help you out now I'll start by explaining what no is cuz I didn't do that yet since I'm a millennial I grew up with the internet I'm just going to search the definition of null in Java cuz it probably does a little bit better at explaining than I can be assigned to any variable of a reference type to indicate that the variable does not refer to any object or erect and that's not helpful at all. I'm sorry I even brought that up
