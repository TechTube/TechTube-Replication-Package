as you can see here we have our old friend integer n initialize to a value of 5 we're going to pass and into a function called change number would simply take send and sets it to 10 if n is now 10 will see that change number operates on and itself rather than a cop let's run this code to see if n is changed at 10 as you can see we passed a cop that means that once we return from change number and is still fought that's the case for passing any parameters
